## Introduction

Hi there, 

Hulkanasium is a fictional gym webpage created as the second Milestone Project for my studies with CodeInstitute. 

The idea of the site similarly to my first project is based on real life experience. The name Hulkanasium is fictional name my collegues and I come up with for a basement gym we had at a Hotel we all worked together in. The gym had a large Hulk picture in the middle that inspired the name. The second project of the web applications course requires the implementation of JavaSript along with html and css as it was in the previous project. To fulfill the requirement I decided to bring Hulkanasium alive and design a website for it, where on top of the usual features of a gym site , I plan to add features for map search and calorie calculator for fitness.
